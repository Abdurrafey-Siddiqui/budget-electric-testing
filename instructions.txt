ðŸ§­ 1. Core Principles (System Foundation)

These are non-negotiable rules that guide all reasoning and generation.

Use only registry-approved components.
All UI elements must be imported exclusively from the custom registries defined in components.json.
No imports are allowed directly from the original SHADCN library or any external packages.

Component integrity enforcement.
Every component reference must resolve to a valid path inside one of the allowed registries. If a component isnâ€™t in a registry, it cannot be used or generated.

Brand and color adherence.
Follow the brand identity, color system, and typography defined in the prompt or configuration.

Conversion-driven design.
Aesthetics must serve usability, persuasion, and lead generation. Each section should guide the user toward a clear conversion action.

SEO and copy synergy.
Copywriting must integrate both marketing psychology and on-page SEO principles seamlessly.

Plan before generating.
Never jump directly to markup or component code. Begin with strategic reasoning: structure, flow, and intent.

ðŸ§© 2. Website Ideation and Planning Phase

Before generating any layout or code, the model should strategically think through:

Business Goals

Define the clientâ€™s conversion objectives (e.g., lead generation, signups, sales).

Identify key metrics for success.

Audience Definition

Understand the target users â€” their motivations, objections, and expectations.

Align tone, visual hierarchy, and layout with their psychology.

Conversion Funnel Design

Map the visitor journey: awareness â†’ engagement â†’ conversion.

Assign each page section a role in supporting this flow.

Information Architecture

Define all necessary pages and sections (e.g. Home, About, Services, Testimonials, Contact).

Ensure the navigation feels intuitive and frictionless.

ðŸŽ¨ 3. Visual and UX Design Workflow

When planning layout and design:

Grid and Spacing System

Follow a consistent grid and spacing system based on Tailwind or SHADCN design conventions.

Maintain generous whitespace and clear visual hierarchy.

Component Selection

Select only from approved SHADCN registry components â€” never from the original SHADCN library.

Reuse modular patterns and design tokens to maintain consistency.

Avoid introducing external component sources or custom unregistered code.

Brand & Color Fidelity

Use the color palette, typography, and imagery provided by the brand spec.

Ensure accessibility: contrast ratios, font sizing, and responsiveness.

Interaction Patterns

Use smooth transitions and subtle motion (e.g., Framer Motion) where appropriate.

Ensure every state (hover, focus, active) is visually consistent and user-friendly.

ðŸ§  4. Copy and SEO Strategy

All textual generation should follow this structured flow:

Headline & Hook

Craft attention-grabbing statements that emotionally connect with the visitor.

Value Proposition

Clearly communicate the unique benefit and differentiation within seconds.

Proof & Trust Elements

Integrate testimonials, reviews, logos, or certifications to build trust.

CTA Optimization

Use strong, clear verbs.

Place CTAs strategically to reduce friction and maximize engagement.

SEO Optimization

Integrate relevant keywords naturally in headings, meta descriptions, and alt tags.

Maintain concise, scannable copy optimized for both humans and search engines.
